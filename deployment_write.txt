1. I'd opt in for Azure for a multi-thread web app as my cloud provider.
2. Just as we did, I'd begin with setting up a container registry to store an image file.
3. Following that step, I would build the image with the respective version tag and push to the registry file.
4. Next, I'd proceed to generate an Azure Container Instance by utilizing the image I previously pushed to the Azure Container Registry in the third step.
5. Lastly, I'd initiate the deployment of the Azure Container Instance, ensuring it becomes accessible and operational.
